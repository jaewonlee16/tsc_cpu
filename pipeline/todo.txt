add nop to pipeline register for calculating num_inst

wwd output must calculate with RegDst_WB(not write_reg_addr_WB) beacause there is no stall

delete ir, ir_write, ir wire etc.
because ir is IFID register

num_branch calculated at WB like wwd.
need to decode instruction at WB.

no register between MEM and WB beacause of negedge write RF.
